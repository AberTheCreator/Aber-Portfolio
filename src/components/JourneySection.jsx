          My Journey
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-6">
          My path into tech started in Web3 as a community builder. I learned quickly that people don't connect to technology just because it works, they connect because it feels intuitive, welcoming, and human.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
          That mindset followed me into development. I taught myself to code, built projects from scratch, and refined my ability to translate ideas into products that are both functional and delightful.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mt-6">
          At the same time, technical writing became part of how I work. I believe great developers don't just solve problems â€” they make their solutions easy for others to use, understand, and build on.
